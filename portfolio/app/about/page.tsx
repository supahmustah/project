// /about.tsx

/* I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong emphasis on
          back-end development. With a solid foundation in JavaScript, C#,
          React, and SQL, I aim to bring both functionality and efficiency to
          the projects I work on. My skill set covers HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and
          Java, allowing me to handle both server-side logic and user-facing
          features. I hold both a Bachelor's and Graduate degree in software
          development, with a focus on delivering scalable, high-quality
          solutions. I'm driven by the desire to see projects come to life and
          make meaningful contributions to their final products. Currently, I'm
          honing my skills with personal projects, including my own portfolio.*/
